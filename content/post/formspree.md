## Hello and welcome to data-handyman.com

I am very excited to be getting this site online!  There are a lot of things
that I am learning through this process, and one of them is creating a form.
Creating a form itself isn't too complicated or interesting to me.  What
interests me about creating forms is the action taken once you press the submit
button.  Really, the amount of things that can be done with the data that you
have filled in the form is endless.  

I want to be able to organize and to keep track of who is trying to
contact me.  Maybe the action can be to send the form data to a database or a
file?  That's one solution, but only part of it.  I still need a way to easily
respond to someone.  A solution that addresses both of these items involves a
form action that emails and organizes the form data into a database or
file.  Oh, by the way did I mention I don't want to spend any money?

I want to talk about a service that addresses part of the above scenario.  
The service is called Formspree if you haven't guessed, and it will enable
a form to send data to my email address.  It is important to me to be able to
organize this data into a database or file, and we will go over how that will
work another time.

### Diving into Formspree

Why Formspree?  Well, aside from it being high in my google search, it seemed
pretty easy to get started.  Google is one of my favorites.  Google is so
awesome, thanks for letting me search for stuff.  But Google is not Formspree,
so let me get back on topic.

I went to this part of Formspree's site to do a quick test:

* [http://testformspree.com/](http://testformspree.com/)

I followed the directions by editing the form then running the test and pressing
the send button.  There is some initial set up; I think they send a
confirmation.  I few minutes (too many) later I was able to set up a form on my
[contact](/contact/) page.

### How is your free lunch?

Ok, so as I mentioned, this service is free.  It seems like I have a solution
that was both cost effective and functions as intended.  But wait!  If you
try to fill out the form on the contact page, you will see that it is not a
seamless process.  What is this redirection to Formspree's website and
reCAPTCHA?  reCAPTCHA?  In my case it's that thing you have to do before that
thing you actually want to do. I don't want you to have to experience this
redirection to Formspree.  The service isn't right for me.

Maybe Formspree isn't exactly what I am looking for, I'll admit.  I can pay them
to remove the reCAPTCHA and redirection, but yea right, I'm a datahandyman.
There's definitely a better solution that is better for you and me.

In the future, I'll go through how to organize the form data that was sent to my
email address.  Right now, I am thinking a script can parse out the information
I want and put it in a database or a file.  I'll keep the Formspree form for
now, but it will be changed, and I'll let you know what I come up with as an
alternative (to Formspree's $9.99 a month gold plan).

### Until next time

Through these posts, I want to share a little about my thought processes,
how I think about data, and how I can help you on your data projects.  If you
are interested in talking with me about your data related project, I would love
