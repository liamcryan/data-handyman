## Why Formspree?

Creating a form itself isn't too complicated or interesting to me.  What
interests me about creating forms is the 'action' taken once you press the submit
button.  Really, the amount of things that can be done with the data that you
have filled in the form is endless.

I also want to be able to respond to the person who is contacting
me.  So, the 'action' I am looking for the form to take is to
email.  In a later section, I want to go over organizing this data, but
the first step is receiving it.

Formspree is the service I will be using to email the form's data if you haven't
guessed already, and it will enable a form to send data to my email address.  

### Diving into Formspree

Why Formspree?  Well, aside from it being high in my google search, it seemed
pretty easy to get started.  Google is one of my favorites.  Google is so
awesome, thanks for letting me search for stuff.  But Google is not Formspree,
so let me get back on topic.

I went to this part of Formspree's site to do a quick test:

* [http://testformspree.com/](http://testformspree.com/)

I followed the directions by editing the form then running the test and pressing
the send button.  There is some initial set up; I think they send a
confirmation.  I few minutes (too many) later I was able to set up a form on my
contact page.

### How is your free lunch?

Ok, so as I mentioned, this service is free.  It seems like Formspree was both
cost effective and functioned as intended.  But wait!  If you
try to fill out the form on the contact page, you will see that it is not a
seamless process.  If you fill out the form on the contact page, you are
 redirected to Formspree's website and required to check a box called a
 reCAPTCHA.  reCAPTCHA?  I don't want you to have to experience this
redirection to Formspree.  The service isn't right for me.

Maybe Formspree isn't exactly what I am looking for, I'll admit.  I can pay them
to remove the reCAPTCHA and redirection, but yea right, I'm a data handyman.
There's definitely a better solution that is better for you and me.  I'll keep
the Formspree form for now, but it will be changed, and I'll let you know what
I come up with as an alternative (to Formspree's $9.99 a month gold plan).

In the future, I'll go through how to organize the form data that was sent to my
email address.  Right now, I am thinking a script can get to the information
that is emailed to me and I can put it in a database or file.

### Until next time
