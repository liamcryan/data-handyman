## Hello and welcome to data-handyman.com

I'm glad you came to look at my web site!  The process of getting this site
online has been fun and I've been learning some fun stuff.

The purpose of this site is to let you know about the ways that a
data handyman can help your data related projects.  I want you to see
how your project can benefit from topics discussed on this site, what has
benefited me, and how to do more with less.

# Origin story

It was six months after graduation and I found my first 'real' job as a data
analyst.  I was greatful to have found a job I had been searching to find for
so long, but the work wasn't quite what I expected.  I couldn't just
apply my education in Statistics to any problem;  the data wasn't clean.  We
had no infrastructure.  We were copying and pasting sheet after sheet, in Excel.

There was one specific experience I had which put me on the path of being a
data handyman, and it started out with a co-worker of mine being required to:

1.  Go to web page 1
2.  Copy data on this page
3.  Paste data into Excel
4.  Repeat steps 1-3 for web page 2, 3,..., 100

My co-worker had to do this every day.  I thought this was crazy, and I was
right.  I did a little research on web scraping and found a way to replicate
my co-worker's process through a programming language called Python.  This
process went from taking hours each day and having great potential for errors
to taking minutes each day and having very little potential for errors.  

I couldn't belive how easy it was to do this web scraping, and I wanted to see
what else was possible.

# Becoming a data handyman
