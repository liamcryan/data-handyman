# The wonderful world of data visualization using PowerPoint

If you have ever tried to create PowerPoints using Python, you have probably
run into [Python-pptx](https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx) library.  It is a
great tool for helping you create PowerPoint presentations.  You can theoritically
replicate anything in any PowerPoint using this library (statement not fact chcecked).  In practice,
the library has limitations and you may find yourself googling how to do something
that the library is not capable of doing.

## Workaround Functions

The creator of the library has written how you can bypass the libraries limitations.  The solution
is to create workaround functions.  I found very few resources that provided the amount of help I
felt I needed for creating a workaround function and decided to help anyone out that was in the same boat I was.
