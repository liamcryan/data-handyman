# Starting out

I really started my career as a data analyst.  About a year or so after my start date, a great coworker come along who 
told me he was learning Python.  He was writing scripts that made my VBA scripts look like a joke.  So I wanted to learn too.

This coworker/friend came up with a cool idea to make a little money on the side.  We were going to create a Python program to
automate some of the tedious aspects of buying and selling products online.  I liked this idea and 
had just bought a course on Udemy called [Complete Python Web Course: Build 8 Python Web Apps](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-python-web-course-learn-by-building-8-apps/).  It 
was a great course, and the content turned out to be very integral in executing the idea.  I spent about a month 
going through the course and applying the material to create a web app.  My friend and I were able to 
use this web app to help find products we could buy and sell online.  We had fun, made some money, and got a 
taste of what it felt like to make money outside an organization.

After this experience I was hooked on Python.  After a while, I didn't want to use Excel or VBA.  Python could do that and 
more.  I felt like I could do more.

# Choosing your path

For a while I thought I wanted to be a data scientist.  And maybe I do someday.  I have a background in mathematics and statistics, an 
advanced degree, and HR really likes to see this on my resume.  A huge part of me thinks it makes sense to strive to be a data scientist and 
that I am not fulfilling my potential if I don't strive to be on that path.

Right now, I am just not interested in the typical things you read about data scientists doing.  On one hand, my background seems really well suited for 
data science.  On the other hand, I would rather be doing other things with data.  It can be stressful having this kind of duality.

I didn't even realize it until yesterday, but the things I really enjoy doing fall more under a role of a data engineer than a data scientist.  With 
that realization, the duality of my situation is vanishing, and I feel like I can go all in with becoming a data engineer without feeling like I am 
missing out on my potential.

# My new path

Becoming a data engineer will take a lot of time and effort, especially not being trained as a software engineer.  But it's what I like doing, and 
what I want to do.  Follow me on my journey by reading this blog :)
