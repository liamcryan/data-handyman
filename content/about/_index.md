I thought starting a blog would be fun.  I like to work with data too, and I've always 
thought of myself as a resourceful person.  I feel like a handyman is resourceful as well; maybe 
not always having the best tool for the job, but being creative enough to figure out how 
to get the job done.  Apparently this led to the term 'data handyman'.

I love to learn things that I can use.  It turns out that as a person working with 
data frequently, learning to program in Python was very useful.  A lot of this blog will talk
about how to get Python to do cool things with data.  

But data is not life.  I will also talk about family, goals, discipline, health, and other things 
that help me to enjoy life.
