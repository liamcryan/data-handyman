      <description>The csv module I want to take a look at understanding the importance of the csv module, as well as when and why it should be used.
Creating a csv file (the old fashioned way) I am going to use the code below to create a csv file, f. You can copy and paste this code below to follow along. If you remember the last post, this should look very familiar.</description>

      <description>Background I have taken for granted the ability to read and write files in Python. There are libraries which make this task very easy, and it is easy to not really understand what is going on. This purpose of this post is to help me to better understand reading and writing to files. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with the built in Python function, open.
open open is a built in Python function which basically opens a connection to your file and let&amp;rsquo;s you interact with the data in the file.</description>
