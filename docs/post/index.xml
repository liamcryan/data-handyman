      <description>Why Formspree? Creating a form itself isn&amp;rsquo;t too complicated or interesting to me. What interests me about creating forms is the &amp;lsquo;action&amp;rsquo; taken once you press the submit button.
I want to be able to respond to the person who is contacting me. So, the &amp;lsquo;action&amp;rsquo; I am looking for the form to take is to email. In a later section, I want to go over organizing this data, but the first step is receiving it.</description>
