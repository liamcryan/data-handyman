      <description>Gmail and Python (part 2) Last time we went over the required steps for getting Python to interact with Gmail. They are:
1) Enable 2 step authentication
2) Create an app password
Finally! Let&amp;rsquo;s get to the data! I want to go over how to get a Formspree email and then send a response to the sender. To search for an email we will be using the imaplib library, and to send, we&amp;rsquo;ll use the smtp library.</description>

      <description>Why Formspree? Creating a form itself isn&amp;rsquo;t too complicated or interesting to me. What interests me about creating forms is the &amp;lsquo;action&amp;rsquo; taken once you press the submit button.
I want to be able to respond to the person who is contacting me. So, the &amp;lsquo;action&amp;rsquo; I am looking for the form to take is to email. In a later section, I want to go over organizing this data, but the first step is receiving it.</description>
