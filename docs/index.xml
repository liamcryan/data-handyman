      <description>Why Formspree? Creating a form itself isn&amp;rsquo;t too complicated or interesting to me. What interests me about creating forms is the &amp;lsquo;action&amp;rsquo; taken once you press the submit button. Really, the amount of things that can be done with the data that you have filled in the form is endless.
I also want to be able to respond to the person who is contacting me. So, the &amp;lsquo;action&amp;rsquo; I am looking for the form to take is to email.</description>
